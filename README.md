# PaleoCOOP

PaleoCOOP is an Evolutionary theoretical Agent-Based Model exploring the effect of cooperation on dispersal under different climate constraints in two study sub-regions, the Altai and Tian Shan Mountains. 

This repository contains data and scripts used in the following paper:
Coto-Sarmiento, M.; Namen, A.; Varis, A. and Iovita, R. (2023): The impact of cooperation under climate constraints: an Agent-Based Model for exploring Paleolithic behavioral adaptations in the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor.

The repository is organised into 3 folders: `model`, `code`, `data`
