# PaleoCOOP

PaleoCOOP is an evolutionary theoretical Agent-Based Model to explore the effect of cooperation on dispersal under different climate constraints in two study sub-regions, the Altai and Tian Shan Mountains. 

This repository contains data and scripts used in the following paper:

* Coto-Sarmiento, M.; Namen, A.; Varis, A. and Iovita, R. (submitted Nov 2023): The impact of cooperation under climate constraints: an Agent-Based Model for exploring Paleolithic behavioral adaptations in the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor. 


The agent-based model and the ODD protocol are available on OSF: 

The repository is organized into 3 folders: `PaleoCOOP_model`, `data_csv`, `protocol` , `scripts`

# Requeriments

* NetLogo 6.2.2
* R version 3.2.4, using the packages `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `reshape2` (data visualization)

# Data structure

* `PaleoCOOP_model`
* `/data_csv` -> .csv file of the archaeological places using in the model
* `protocol` -> ODD protocol
* `scripts` -> scripts for the graphics (R program)
