# PaleoCOOP

PaleoCOOP is an evolutionary theoretical Agent-Based Model to explore the effect of cooperation on dispersal under different climate constraints in two study sub-regions, the Altai and Tian Shan Mountains. 

This repository contains data and scripts used in the following preprint:

* Coto-Sarmiento, M.; Namen, A.; Varis, A. and Iovita, R. (submitted Nov 2023): The impact of cooperation under climate constraints: an Agent-Based Model for exploring Paleolithic behavioral adaptations in the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor. 


The agent-based model and the ODD protocol are available on OSF: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/JM3ZY

The repository is organized into 3 folders: `PaleoCOOP_model`, `data_csv`, `protocol`, `scripts`

**Please note that the article is a preprint and has not yet been peer-reviewed. Therefore, both the article and the model itself can change**

# Requeriments

# Data structure

* `/PaleoCOOP_model` -> this folder includes:
   * The NetLogo model
   * `/data/maps` -> DEM and shapefiles for the model
* `/data_csv` -> .csv file of the archaeological places used in the model
